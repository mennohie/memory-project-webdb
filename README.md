Project where we make a memory web application game for the course Web and Databases

Memorio - a quick memory game that improves your brain - that is our motto.

The game is a fast-paced two-player memory game with a time limit of (to be determined) seconds per turn.
he images on the memory cards show "Delfts Blauwe" tiles with arbitrary wisdom proverbs
The game improves your brain in two ways:
 - It increases your short term memory by playing the memory card game
 - It increases your wisdom by reading the wisdom proverbs. ;-)
 
Furthermore, we chose to show statistics on how many brains were improved (amount of games played). We also show the highest winning streak on the splash screen together with your own personal best winning streak.
